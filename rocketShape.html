    <h2>How does a rocket engine create the forces needed for thrust?</h1>
    <p>As talked about <a href="thrust.html">here</a>, rocket engines generate
        thrust by accelerating the exhaust gasses out which creates the force to generate thrust.
        Now I want to talk about how these engines are able to accelerate the gasses.
    </p>
    <h2>Why engines look the way they do</h2>

    <p>Most engines tend to have this hour glass looking shape, this is to exploit Bernoulli's principle.
        Bernoulli's equations are long and complex but what they mean is such: 
        when you have a fluid travelling down a tube it will have a set flow rate. This flow rate 
        is a combination of how much water is moving down the tube and how fast it is moving. 
        When the pressure is consistent, this flow rate is consistent. So no matter how you change the shape 
        of the tube it will always have the same flow of a fluid through it.
    </p>
    <div class="annotations">
        <ul class="labelsleft">
            <p>High Pressure</p>
            <p>Low Velocity</p>
        </ul>
        <img id="flow" src="images/Bernoulli.png" alt="A diagram showing a tube with a converging diverging pinch.">
        <ul class="labelsright">
            <p>Low Presure</p>
            <p>High Velocity</p>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>What this means in the case of rocket engines is that if you pinch a section of the tube, restricting the amount of fluid that 
        can flow through, the fluid must speed up to have the same flow rate as before.
        This acceleration of the fluid is what generates the thrust by producing a <a href="thrust.html">force</a>.
    </p>

        But for rocket engines to be igniting fuels and producing incredibly hot flames, you might be wondering 
        how these engines dont blow up or melt from the heat. If you are then 
        you should check out <a href="rocketcooling.html">how rockets stay cool</a>.
