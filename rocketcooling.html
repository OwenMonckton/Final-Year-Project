    <h2>How do rocket engines stay cool?</h2>
    <p>As I've discussed in the other sections, rocket engines produce 
        thrust by igniting a fuel and then accelerating the exhaust.
        Unlike a car engine or a turbine engine, these fules can burn 
        at thousands of degrees for long periods of time. 
        So at such high temperatures for prelonged periods, why doesn't a 
        rocket engine melt?
    </p>
    <h2>How rockets are engineered to stay cool</h2>
    <p>
        Engineers designed some very clever solutions to combat the 
        heat of the internal combuistion chamber. One of these solutions
        envolves pumping cryogenic liquid oxygen around the engine to 
        cool it down.

    <p>
        The image above is of the RS-25 engine use on the space shuttle, 
        it has a series of pipes that run along the outside of the 
        engine nozzle. These pipes pump liquid oxygen around to combat 
        the hot temperatures that can reach up to ~900°C! The nozzle 
        of a rocket engine is not as hot as the combustion chamber so a 
        solution like this wouldn't work.

        How to cool a combustion chamber
    </h2>
    <p>
        The combustion chamber of a rocket engine can reach upwards of 
        3300°C, the previous method discussed would not be able to pull 
        that much heat out of the system. As a result engineers designed 
        a new solution capable of dealing with this heat.

    <p>
        In the walls of the combustion chamber are small cut outs
        that allow for a liquid to flow through them. By cooling 
        the walls this way it means that the heat can be directly 
        taken away rather than having a buffer like with the pipes above.
        Without this system in place the engine would melt the walls 
        away and eventually blow up.
