    <p>This table works off 2 equations. Thrust = Mass flow X Exhaust Velocity, and 
        Specific Impulse (Isp) = Exhaust Velocity X 9.81. Thrust is of course 
        how much force the engine can generate at max throttle. Specific impulse is a 
        measurement of efficiency. It tells you how efficient an engine is by how long it can 
        produce a set amount of thrust given a set fuel load. So for example, if an engine has 
        100 seconds of Specific Impulse that means it can produce 1kg of thrust for 100 seconds 
        from 1kg of fuel. So the larger the specific impulse, the more efficient the rocket engine.
    </p>
    <p>To achieve such high specific impulse you have to accelerate your exhaust gasses 
        extremely fast while at the same time not shooting out heavy amounts of exhaust gasses.
        This is why nuclear hydrogen engines are so efficient. They can super heat gasses hotter then 
        combustion making the gasses super fast and by using hydrogen (which is the smallest element and
        lightest gas) they have a very light mass flow. They can accelerate smaller and lighter gasses faster.
        They can have specfic impulses upwards of 900 seconds compared to combustion that can only reach a peak 
        of 450!
